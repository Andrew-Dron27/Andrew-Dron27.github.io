              <p>
                I am 25 years old and graduated from the University of Utah in 2020 with a bachelors in Computer Science with a specializtion
                in systems engineering.
                I have 4 years of professional work experience in the tech industry with 3 years as an intern working at Becton Dickinson,
                and 1 year as a software engineer at Sorenson Communications.
                My main experience is in developing user facing products that range from ultrasound needle tracking devices to web video 
                services for sign language relay interpreters.
                I have most experience in C#, javascript and typescript, react, flutter, and C++
                Currently in my free time I am studying the language Rust. It may not be as ubiquitous as Python or Go but Rust's 
                robust compiler adds the ability for writing performance code that is programmatically safe.
              </p>

                Outside of work I love cycling, rock climbing, snowboarding, and playing guitar. Last year I resigned from my full time position
                at Sorenson to pursue and adventurous opportunity to cycle across Norway with my cousin. We did about 3 weeks of bikepacking,
                and I spent the next 2 months backpacking through Europe. It was truly the adventure of a lifetime, and I wouldnt trade it for 
                anything, but it explains my current situation of seeking employment.
              </p>

              <p>
                I absolulty am confident in my abilites to perform as a software engineer in industry. I was consistently received grades
                at the top of my class and worked as an intern while going to school. I was and still am unhappy that I had to leave
                my position at Sorenson after only a year since I felt I still had much to learn there. However, my travels have left me 
                given me a much broader perspective on life and the world
                and have left me better to not only deal with the technical side of software development, but also the people and communication side.
                I am more assured in my abilites to assist in the creation of complex programs and solving difficult
                problems than ever. I am just waiting for an opportunity to demonstrate that.
