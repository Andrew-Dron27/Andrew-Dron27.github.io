    <h1>About me</h1>
    <div id="about">
        <p>
          I am 25 years old and graduated from the University of Utah in 2020 with a bachelors in Computer Science.
          I have 4 years of professional work experience in the tech industry with 3 years as an intern working at Becton Dickinson,
          and 1 year as a software engineer at Sorenson Communications.
          My main experience is in developing user facing products that range from ultrasound needle tracking devices to web video 
          services for sign language relay interpreters.
          I have most experience in C#, javascript and typescript, react, flutter, and C++
          Currently in my free time I am studying the language Rust and its asynchronous libraries, so that I can use it 
          for a restfull service that provides both perfromance and programatic saftey.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of work I love cycling, rock climbing, snowboarding, and playing guitar. Last year I resigned from my full time position
          at Sorenson to pursue and adventurous opportunity to cycle across Norway with my cousin. We did about 3 weeks of bikepacking,
          and I spent the next 2 months backpacking through Europe. It was truly the adventure of a lifetime, and I wouldnt trade it for 
          anything, but it explains my current situation of seeking employment.
        </p>
        <p>
          I absolulty am confident in my abilites to perform as a software engineer in industry. I was consistently received grades
          at the top of my class and worked as an intern while going to school. I was and still am unhappy that I had to leave
          my position at Sorenson after only a year since I felt I still had much to learn there. However, my travels have left me 
          a much more confident person better to not only deal with the technical side of software development, 
          but also the people and communication side.
          I am more assured in my abilites to assist in the creation of complex programs and solving difficult
          problems than ever. I am just waiting for and opportunity to demonstrate that.
        </p>
