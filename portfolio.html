                  CPA secure client/server project that allows for server side grayscaling of images encrypted using the CKKS homomorphic encryption algorithm
                  Client reads image files into rgb channel chunks and converts them into encrypted polynomials.
                  Server performs grayscaling using averaging method on encrypted channel chunks

                  a backend in Java. Currently I am working on setting up the server, as well as calculating checkmate.
