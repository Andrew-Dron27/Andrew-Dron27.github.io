            I have experience building and maintaining complex web applications written in JavaScript and TypeScript as well as Flutter from my previous positions.
            I also have experience with C# and C++ from my work as an engineering intern at Becton Dickinson and Python and Java from my time at university and my personal projects.
            My resume documents these activities .

            In June 2022 I resigned from Sorenson Communications to pursue an opportunity to travel, mostly by bicycle, throughout Europe, Canada and Alaska with my cousin and several family friends.
            It wasn't an easy decision as I enjoyed working at Sorenson Communications but the trip was a once in a lifetime opportunity that I felt I could not pass up.
            It proved to be time well spent.

            This international travel has broadened my outlook and understanding of our world.
            Since I returned I have been programming independently in order to maintain my skills. These activities involve personal projects, online programming quizzes, and algorithm questions.
            Currently I am studying the language rust and its applications for web and systems development. I am highly motivated and prepared for the next challenge.
